Strømregnskab plugin structure (recommended)

Root
- stromregnskab.php
  - Plugin header + constants + bootstrap. This file only loads the plugin and defines shared constants.

includes/
- stromregnskab-plugin.php
  - Main plugin logic and hooks (legacy code moved here to keep the bootstrap slim).

admin/
- Intended for admin-only classes, screens, and assets.

public/
- Intended for front-end/public-facing classes, shortcodes, and assets.

assets/
- Shared static assets (images, CSS, JS) that are not scoped to admin/public.

languages/
- Translation files (e.g., .po/.mo).

Notes
- Future refactors should split includes/stromregnskab-plugin.php into smaller classes
  (e.g., activator, repositories, services) to follow WordPress best practices.
